  <p>
    Specify the delay in seconds between retry attempts when uploading artifacts to Artifactory fails.
  </p>
  <p>
    The default value is 15 seconds. Shorter delays may cause retries to fail if the issue is temporary,
    while longer delays may unnecessarily extend job execution time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Recommended range:</strong> 5-30 seconds for most network environments.
