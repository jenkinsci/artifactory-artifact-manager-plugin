<div>
  <p>
    Specify the maximum number of times to retry uploading artifacts to Artifactory when a failure occurs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The default value is 0 retries (no retries). Higher values provide more resilience against transient network issues,
    but may cause jobs to take longer when Artifactory is persistently unavailable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Set to 0 to disable retries - operations will fail immediately on the first error.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Recommended range:</strong> 0-5 retries for most use cases.
  </p>
</div>
